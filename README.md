# Java Problem Solving

This repository contains a collection of problem-solving questions solved using Java. The solutions are designed to help improve problem-solving skills and demonstrate various Java concepts and techniques.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 23.0.2** (Released on 2025-01-21)
  - You can download the JDK from the official [Oracle JDK website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository using Git. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ebdullah/Problem-Solving-with-Java.git
```

### 2. Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA

1. Launch IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Select **Open** and choose the cloned repository directory.
3. IntelliJ IDEA will automatically detect and configure the project for you.

### 3. Set Up JDK 23.0.2 in IntelliJ IDEA

If your project is not automatically using Java 23.0.2, follow these steps:

1. Go to **File > Project Structure**.
2. Under **Project Settings**, select **Project**.
3. In the **Project SDK** dropdown, choose **JDK 23.0.2** (make sure it's installed).

### 4. Run a Java File

1. Locate and open any `Main.java` file in the `src/com` directory for a particular problem.
2. Click the **Run** button (green play icon) in IntelliJ IDEA to execute the program.

## Problem Solving

Each Java file in the `src` folder contains a solution for a specific problem. The problems may vary in difficulty and can involve different algorithms and data structures. You can explore the code, modify it, or use it as a reference for your own practice.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
